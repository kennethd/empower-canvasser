# Problem Description
At Empower, we do a good job of helping people reach out to friends and family
over the long term.  But a lot of the organizations we work with also do
canvassing -- talking to a bunch of new people that they don't know yet and
getting their information down quickly -- and we want to add support for that.

Your assignment is to make a minimal canvassing web app.

Some implementation notes:
  * You should have one page that lets a canvasser write down a name and some
    free-form notes about a person they just talked to.  
  * You should have another page that lets the canvasser view all of their
    canvassing notes. 
  * It's okay if you don't have a user login / authentication system implemented.  
  * It's okay if your pages are simple and/or ugly
  * Your backend should have some sort of a JSON API.  
  * Please provide any documentation necessary to run your code and try it out.
  * Make a git repo with an initial commit when you start working, and include
    the repo in your submission
  * We understand that a lot of folks are experimenting with AI coding tools,
	particularly in interviews.  If you want to, that's fine!  Just say that you're
	using AI in your readme.  Since a greenfield app like this is something AI
	should be good at, if you're using AI, we'll also expect you to get more of the
	"extra credit" done.
  * At Empower, we use React (with hooks) for the frontend, Node for the
	backend, MySQL for the database, and Typescript.  Using these technologies
	would be ideal, but if you need to use the technologies of your choice, that's
	okay too.

## Logistics
We don't want this to be a burden on your schedule!  We expect it to take under
4 hours.  We won't be strictly timing you or anything, but please don't spend
much more time than that.  If you are trying out our tech stack for the first
time (and have room in your schedule), it's okay to take a little extra time
too.

You can do it any time over the next week or so (if you have a busy week and
need more time, just let us know).  

Email your completed assignment to code-submissions@getempower.com (any way is
fine -- a GitHub link, a zip file, a tarball, etc)

## What are we looking for?
You'll need to do full stack development at Empower, so I want to make sure
that you're comfortable with doing something simple in frontend, backend, and
with the database.

Try to approach this project similar to how you would if you were actually
working on this as part of your job.  E.g., it's okay to use StackOverflow.
The code quality matters as much as getting the feature done, so pay attention
to style, design choices, comments, architecture, automated testing, making it
easy to extend, etc, just like you would when writing code normally.

If you need to make any simplifying assumptions, or if you don't have time to
do things exactly how you would normally, that's okay!  Just document it.

## If you have extra time...
Some ideas for enhancements to make to your project if you finish early:

  * Implement users and authentication
  * Allow editing the canvassing notes
  * Add an email field, and add some validation on that email
  * Make it possible to search across canvassing notes
  * Make it possible to export the canvassing results as CSV
  * Make the pages look nice
  * Make the pages look nice on mobile
  * Actually deploy it on a server somewhere
