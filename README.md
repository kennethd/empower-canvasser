# empower-canvasser
Simple canvassing app for [Empower Project](https://empowerproject.us/)

This app is comprised of three components:

  * React frontend
  * Node.js API service
  * MySQL database

Deployment will be containerized with Docker

Development will be done locally via a monorepo including both front & back end



# developer environment

Dev env/test deployment server is the same machine running:
```
$ node --version ; npm --version
v22.18.0
10.9.3
```
I believe `pnpm` works a litle more intuitively with monorepos:
```
$ npm install -g pnpm
```
